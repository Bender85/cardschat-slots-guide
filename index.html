        <p>Chances are you’ve seen bits and pieces of how blackjack is played, even if you’ve never actually played yourself. Wherever you are on the spectrum of experience, it’s never a bad idea to brush up on the basics: </p>

        <p>Figuring out which hand wins is really easy. If a player gets 21 with his first two cards, it’s an automatic win as long as the dealer doesn’t get a blackjack too. Otherwise, the player wins if their hand adds up to more than the dealer while also not going over 21. Let’s look at some examples.</p>

      <!-- <div class="how-to-play__paylines">
        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">paylines expained</h3>
        <p>There’s a big difference between playing one payline and playing 25. The more paylines you play, the more often you’re going to win and hit special bonuses. You also have more chances to hit a jackpot. It comes with a price, however, since you have to place a separate bet on each payline you’re playing.</p>

        <p>A lot of players like choosing a lower denomination coin that allows them to max out the paylines while keeping the total bet at a manageable level. Other people prefer to play a smaller number of paylines with a bigger bet riding on each. The truth is, it’s more exciting to hit lots of winning combinations which is why you see new machines pushing the limits with more and more paylines.</p>

      <div class="edge-work">
        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">how does house edge work?</h3>
        <p>Casino games always have a house edge, that’s the casino’s statistical advantage that’s built right into the rules of the game. People love blackjack because it actually allows you to use strategy to lower the house edge or, in some cases, turn the odds in your own favor.</p>
        <p>It’s important to remember that the house edge can’t tell you how much you’ll win or lose in one session. The more you play, however, the closer your numbers will be to the statistical house edge. The important thing to remember is that how well you play has a direct effect on the house edge in blackjack. Let’s look at an example to show you what we mean.</p>

        <div class="edge-work__container">
          <p>Lisa is an <span class="extra-bold">experienced blackjack player</span> and <span class="extra-bold">is playing near-perfect strategy</span> which gives the house an <span class="extra-bold">edge of 0.8%</span>.</p>

      <p>Million-dollar jackpots are the dream of every self-respecting player. Everyone gets to win hundreds of dollars, and lots of people get to win thousands, but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience to hit a truly big jackpot.</p>
      <p>The jackpots that get the biggest are called “Progressive Jackpots”. That means a small part of each wager is added to the jackpot. It keeps increasing until someone hits it. Until someone wins it, it just keeps growing and growing.</p>
      <p>Massive progressive jackpots aren’t available on all games, and usually, you have to be betting a certain amount in order to qualify. If you want a chance at them, make sure to research the games and the qualification criteria to make sure you’re eligible. Here’s a look at some of the biggest online progressive jackpot slots on the planet.</p>

      <p>Within most games are mini-games, also called bonus games or bonus rounds. You trigger them by hitting three special symbols like Bonus or Scatter. Different games work in different ways but the one really common bonus is a set of free spins. The game will auto-spin 20 times, for example, and you get to keep all the winnings. In other games, a second screen will appear and let you spin a wheel or play a new game to win special prizes.</p>

      <p>Real-life slot machines were originally 100% mechanical, the outcomes decided by complicated machines. Then came electrical circuits and eventually computer chips. That was when virtual random-number generators were first used in gambling.</p>

        <p>The random number generator is a computer algorithm that constantly produces complicated runs of numbers that are used to decide the outcomes slots and other casino games. While they’ve been proven to fall short of true randomness in a mathematical sense, they’ve been accepted to be more than adequate for online gambling.</p>

          <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">How They Work</h3>
          <p>Online casino software has the RNG built into every single game and it’s always running. The RNG creates numbers between 1 and 10 digits long, hundreds of times every second. Each of the numbers corresponds in a certain way to a symbol and possible position on a reel. When the player hits the spin button, the game chooses the numbers created that millisecond to decide the game’s outcome.</p>

      <p>Long before anyone had even heard of a computer, let alone the internet, people loved gambling on slot machines.

      <p>A close relative to the slot machine, video poker is another game that’s easy to play, lots of fun and offers a chance at big jackpots. It’s also another example of a game that successfully made the jump from brick and mortar casinos into our favorite online gambling sites.</p>
      <div class="what__video-poker">
        <h4 class="title-h4 center__bottom--line">What is Video Poker?</h4>
        <p>Video poker machines feature games like Jacks or Better, Double Bonus Poker and Deuces Wild, to name just a few. The most common games play like a five-card draw.
        <p>You win based on how big a poker hand you make according to a pay-table posted above the game. Each hand the player receives five cards and then has the option to trade zero to five cards for new ones.</p>
        </p>

      <p>We’ll get to the ways video poker is similar to slots but there are a few key differences, most importantly it usually requires more skill and strategy. Make sure you understand the rules of the game you’re playing and don’t treat it like a slot machine.</p>
