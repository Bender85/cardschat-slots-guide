        <p>Chances are you’ve seen bits and pieces of how blackjack is played, even if you’ve never actually played yourself. Wherever you are on the spectrum of experience, it’s never a bad idea to brush up on the basics: </p>

        <p>Figuring out which hand wins is really easy. If a player gets 21 with his first two cards, it’s an automatic win as long as the dealer doesn’t get a blackjack too. Otherwise, the player wins if their hand adds up to more than the dealer while also not going over 21. Let’s look at some examples.</p>

      <!-- <div class="how-to-play__paylines">
        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">paylines expained</h3>
        <p>There’s a big difference between playing one payline and playing 25. The more paylines you play, the more often you’re going to win and hit special bonuses. You also have more chances to hit a jackpot. It comes with a price, however, since you have to place a separate bet on each payline you’re playing.</p>

        <p>A lot of players like choosing a lower denomination coin that allows them to max out the paylines while keeping the total bet at a manageable level. Other people prefer to play a smaller number of paylines with a bigger bet riding on each. The truth is, it’s more exciting to hit lots of winning combinations which is why you see new machines pushing the limits with more and more paylines.</p>

      <div class="edge-work">
        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">how does house edge work?</h3>
        <p>Casino games always have a house edge, that’s the casino’s statistical advantage that’s built right into the rules of the game. People love blackjack because it actually allows you to use strategy to lower the house edge or, in some cases, turn the odds in your own favor.</p>
        <p>It’s important to remember that the house edge can’t tell you how much you’ll win or lose in one session. The more you play, however, the closer your numbers will be to the statistical house edge. The important thing to remember is that how well you play has a direct effect on the house edge in blackjack. Let’s look at an example to show you what we mean.</p>

        <div class="edge-work__container">
          <p>Lisa is an <span class="extra-bold">experienced blackjack player</span> and <span class="extra-bold">is playing near-perfect strategy</span> which gives the house an <span class="extra-bold">edge of 0.8%</span>.</p>

      <p>Million-dollar jackpots are the dream of every self-respecting player. Everyone gets to win hundreds of dollars, and lots of people get to win thousands, but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience to hit a truly big jackpot.</p>
      <p>The jackpots that get the biggest are called “Progressive Jackpots”. That means a small part of each wager is added to the jackpot. It keeps increasing until someone hits it. Until someone wins it, it just keeps growing and growing.</p>
      <p>Massive progressive jackpots aren’t available on all games, and usually, you have to be betting a certain amount in order to qualify. If you want a chance at them, make sure to research the games and the qualification criteria to make sure you’re eligible. Here’s a look at some of the biggest online progressive jackpot slots on the planet.</p>

      <p>Unlike other games like baccarat, or betting on red and black in roulette, blackjack doesn’t have a fixed house edge. That’s because, as a player, you have so many strategy decisions at your disposal. An experienced player who plays properly can get the house edge down to half a percent but a beginner who doesn’t learn basic strategy will be giving the casino a way bigger edge. Don’t make that mistake.</p>

                  <span>If you’re dealt a pair of aces or a pair of eights, always split them. Two eights give you 16, which is the worst hand in blackjack. Splitting aces gives you the chance of hitting two naturals or drawing to a great hand. Conversely, never split two 10-point cards since you’re very unlikely to do better than a 20.</span>

                  <span>Doubling down is a really important way of getting more money on the table when the odds are in your favor. You should double down when you have a total of ten, but not if the dealer also has a 10-point card or an ace showing. You should also double down when you have 11 and the dealer is showing anything except an ace.</span>

                    <span>Whether it’s live or online, look for games where the dealer has to hit on soft 17 and they use the lowest number of decks possible. Also look for games that allow you to hit and re-split aces. When you split aces at some casinos they will only give each ace one more card, not allowing you to double down, hit, or re-split.</span>

      <p>After you’ve learned how to play every situation (your hand + dealer up-card), you’re ready to move on to advanced strategies like counting cards. Being able to use card-counting techniques is difficult and requires fast observation, good recall, basic math skills, and the acting skills to do it all without the dealer or pit boss spotting you.</p>

      <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">CARD COUNTING</h3>
      <p>As long as there have been casinos, there have been people trying to outsmart the house. Counting cards is one way they actually succeeded. </p>
      <p>The idea is that when there are lots of 10-point cards in the deck, it favors the player. By keeping track of all the cards being dealt, players can identify times when there are more 10-point cards still to come and then pile on the bets while their chances are the best.</p>
      <p>In theory, it’s pretty straightforward. The challenge is keeping track of everything as it happens quickly in a real game and being able to do it without attracting the casino’s attention. While it’s not technically illegal, casinos will bar you from games if they catch you counting.</p>

          <p>If you want to win at blackjack, you shouldn’t even read this section on insurance. Just skip this bet altogether and save your money.</p>
          <p>Insurance is a special side bet the dealer offers when they’re showing an ace. Basically, it’s a bet on them getting a blackjack and pays out 2 to 1 if you win. Since statistically, the dealer gets a blackjack less than half the time, it’s pretty easy to see that this is a losing bet in the long run and should be avoided by beginner and intermediate players.</p>

      <p>For advanced players who count cards, however, insurance is one of the most powerful bets. That’s because when the count favors the player, it means there are more tens than usual in the deck. That means that when the dealer is showing an ace he’s way more likely to make a blackjack.</p>

        <p>The random number generator is a computer algorithm that constantly produces complicated runs of numbers that are used to decide the outcomes slots and other casino games. While they’ve been proven to fall short of true randomness in a mathematical sense, they’ve been accepted to be more than adequate for online gambling.</p>

Each of the numbers corresponds in a certain way to a symbol and possible position on a reel. When the player hits the spin button, the game chooses the numbers created that millisecond to decide the game’s outcome.</p>

                    <p>Nikrasch was a master locksmith and successfully developed ways to manually trigger jackpots. He was caught and the story goes that he traded some of his secrets in exchange for a reduced sentence.</p>

      <p>A close relative to the slot machine, video poker is another game that’s easy to play, lots of fun and offers a chance at big jackpots. It’s also another example of a game that successfully made the jump from brick and mortar casinos into our favorite online gambling sites.</p>
      <div class="what__video-poker">
        <h4 class="title-h4 center__bottom--line">What is Video Poker?</h4>
        <p>Video poker machines feature games like Jacks or Better, Double Bonus Poker and Deuces Wild, to name just a few. The most common games play like a five-card draw.
        <p>You win based on how big a poker hand you make according to a pay-table posted above the game. Each hand the player receives five cards and then has the option to trade zero to five cards for new ones.</p>
        </p>

      <p>We’ll get to the ways video poker is similar to slots but there are a few key differences, most importantly it usually requires more skill and strategy. Make sure you understand the rules of the game you’re playing and don’t treat it like a slot machine.</p>
