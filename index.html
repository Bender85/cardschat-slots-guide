    <section class="free-play-slots inner__container">
      <h2 id="play-slots" class="title-h2 center__bottom--line">#2 - Paytables explained</h2>
      <p>A paytable tells you the payouts for all the winning poker hands for that game. All the winning hands are listed in the left column. As you move to the right in the table it tells you the payouts depending on how many credits you bet.</p>

      <div class="">
        <img src="" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>All the numbers refer to the number of coins you will win for each winning hand. Notice that the odds get better as you bet more credits per hand. The best odds are always reserved for when you bet max credits.</p>

      <div class="">
        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">HOW PAYTABLES CAN DIFFER</h3>
        <p>The most important differences between video poker games are the levels of risk and reward, also called variance. Looking at the game’s paytable is the easiest way to figure out how risky a game is. Some games have really big payouts but you have to hit huge hands to get them. Others have smaller payouts but you only have to hit smaller hands to win.</p>

        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <img src="" alt="">
            <div class="">
              <span>WILD CARD GAMES</span>
              <span>The biggest difference you’ll see in pay tables is in games that use wild cards. Since it’s so much easier to make big hands when you have wild cards, the minimum winning hand is always way bigger and the corresponding payouts are smaller compared to non-wild card games.</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <img src="" alt="">
            <div class="">
              <span>PROGRESSIVE JACKPOT GAMES</span>
              <span>Similar to slots, some video poker games have a progressive jackpot that keeps growing until someone wins it. A little bit out of each bet goes to the jackpot which usually means the payouts are a little bit worse compared to non-jackpot games.</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We always advise checking the paytable before you start playing, as it will greatly impact how much you can win.</p>

      <h2 id="tournaments" class="title-h2 center__bottom--line">#4 - odds, house edge, and payouts</h2>
      <p>Some of the reasons video poker is so popular are the odds, payouts, and house edge. They’re all really good compared to lots of other popular casino games. In this section we’ll explain how the house edge works in video poker and explore the odds of getting different hands and their payouts.</p>

      <table></table>

      <p>Remember, the payouts for the same poker hands can be totally different depending on the game you’re playing. Also note that when there’s a wild card involved, the chances of getting big hands go way up.</p>

      <div class="slots-tips__types-tournaments top-blackjack-tips">
          <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">HOW THE HOUSE EDGE WORKS</h3>
          <p>The house edge refers to the statistical advantage that casinos build into their games in order to turn a profit. The good news when it comes to video poker is that if you use proper strategy, the house edge can be less than one per cent.</p>

          <div class="">
            <div class="">
              <div class="">
                <div class="">
                  <div class="global__item-style--title center__bottom--line">how to calculate house edge</div>
                  <ul>
                    <li>First calculate the odds of making each winning poker hand.</li>
                    <li>Next figure out how much each winning hand pays out.</li>
                    <li>Compare the odds and payouts to see how much, on average, you will win for every $100 you bet.</li>
                    <li>The difference between how much you bet and how much you win, expressed as a percent, is the house edge.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <img src="./assets/images/5_always_split_aces_and_eights.png" alt="">
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

        <p>Video poker is similar to blackjack in that the house edge changes dramatically based on how smart a strategy you’re playing. Making lots of mistakes in video poker will send the house edge through the roof while making all the right moves will send the casino’s edge plummeting to almost nothing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="">
        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">video poker payouts</h3>
        <p>One thing that’s really important to understand is that different kinds of video poker have different payouts. When you’re playing Deuces Wild, for example, the payout for a full house is tiny. The same hand in Jacks or Better, however, pays out three times as much. So how do you use what we’ve learned about video poker payouts to pick the game that’s right for you?</p>

                <div class="global__item-style--title center__bottom--line">risk/reward ratio</div>
                <ul>
                  <li>Games like Jacks or Better have bigger payouts for smaller, more common hands and smaller payouts for big hands.</li>
                  <li>Games like Double Bonus Poker are weighted more towards bigger payouts for big hands with smaller payouts for small hands.</li>
                  <li>Games like Deuces Wild are the most heavily weighted towards big hands with a much higher minimum qualifying hand.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Choosing the right game comes down to identifying how much risk you’re willing to take on in exchange for the chance to win bigger prizes. Jacks or Better has low risk and low reward so you can make a smaller bankroll last a long time. Games like Double Bonus Poker, on the other hand, are more volatile but give you the chance to win a bigger prize.</p>

              <span>jacks or better</span>
              <span>This is the lowest variance video poker game. The minimum winning hand is a pair of jacks or better which pays out 1 to 1. The payouts are weighted more heavily towards smaller hands. That means less risk and less reward. The highest hand is a Royal Flush which pays out 4,000 coins when you bet max credits. Look for machines that pay out nine credits for a full house and six credits for a flush, these are known as 9/6 Jacks or Better or “full-pay”.</span>

              <span>wild card</span>
              <span>Wild card video poker games have more risk and more reward compared to Jacks or Better. The minimum winning hand is usually three of a kind which pays out 1 to 1. You’ll notice the payouts are a lot lower than other games but because there are wild cards it’s way easier to make big hands. Wild Card games are fast-paced and offer tons of action.</span>

              <span>This style of game plays a lot differently compared to the ones we’ve covered so far and it’s a lot of fun. Instead of being dealt five cards, you receive two pairs of cards. One appears on the left and one on the right of your screen. You must choose one of the cards on the right. This card is added to the two cards on the left and then two more cards are automatically dealt to make your five-card hand.</span>

              <span>Multi-hand or multi-play video poker is an exciting twist that’s available on most popular games like Jacks or Better and Deuces Wild. In this version the gameplay is the same, except when you hit the Draw button. Instead of just dealing your draw once, the machine will automatically deal three, five, 50, or even 100 hands, depending on the machine. A fresh deck is used for each hand and you get paid out on winning hands just like in the single-play version.</span>

              <span>Progressive jackpot video poker is a special add-on that’s available in many of the most popular video poker games. In these games a small part of each bet goes towards a huge jackpot that keeps growing until someone wins it. The upside is that if you get lucky you can win a seriously big prize. The downside is that the jackpot comes at the expense of worse payouts for some of the other smaller hands.</span>

        <p>Just like slot machines, video poker is also offered in a tournament format and it’s an awesome way to compete against other people while playing the game you love. Tournaments are usually limited to a certain number of hands or period of time and whoever finishes with the biggest profit wins.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Video poker tournaments are often set up as a promotion by the casino to reward its best players. In order to qualify you must be signed up for the rewards program so it’s another great reason to always use your rewards card when you play at an offline casino.</p>

        <h3 class="title-h3 center__bottom--line">Expected Etiquette</h3>
        <p>Since you’re playing one-on-one with your own machine, there are a lot less etiquette rules to worry about compared to a game where you’re interacting with other players and a dealer.</p>
        <p>That said, there are a few key rules to be aware of to make your experience as smooth as possible. It’s also important to remember that these rules only apply to offline video poker in real-life casinos. </p>

            <span>If you’re playing to get free drinks, always tip the bartender at least $1 for every drink. Most casinos will also ask you to play continuously and sometimes they’ll even make you bet max credits if you’re drinking for free.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <span>button-slapping</span>
            <span>The single biggest pet peeve of video poker players is when someone beside them is loudly smacking the buttons every time they make a play. Don’t do it. In fact, don’t make any overly loud noises that may annoy other players.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <span>Personal space</span>
            <span>If there’s a long row of free machines, consider leaving a buffer of a machine or two between you and strangers who are also playing. It’s definitely possible to be social and make conversation while also respecting people’s personal space.</span>

            <p>The Sittman and Pitt Company in New York release the world’s first poker machine. It had five wheels which each had ten playing cards printed on them. The machine’s wheels would spin and come to rest to make a five-card poker hand. Ten years later they introduced a draw version that allowed players to choose which cards to hold and re-spin to replace the others. Gambling was illegal at the time so winning hands were paid in cigarettes and liquor.

            <p> A man named Si Redd who worked for Bally’s Gaming presented an idea for a new game called video poker. Bally’s rejected the idea and Redd took the patent to Fortune Coin Company in Reno, Nevada. By the beginning of the 1980s Redd was mass-producing video poker machines and putting them in casinos all over the United States. Redd went on to create the company International Gaming Technology (IGT) which became a serious force in the casino industry.</p>
